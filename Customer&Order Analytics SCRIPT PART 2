-- 1. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%New York%'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING Quantity >= 3;

SELECT distinct location, count(orderID) AS numberOfOrders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%New York%'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING Quantity >= 3;

-- 2.How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales;

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%Headphones%'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

-- 3. What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)
SELECT sum(feb.Quantity*feb.price)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(feb.orderID)=6
AND feb.orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- 4. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
SELECT sum(Quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(feb.orderID)=6
AND feb.orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- 5. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total
SELECT  Product, sum(Quantity*price) AS ProductRevenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product 
ORDER BY ProductRevenue desc LIMIT 1;
